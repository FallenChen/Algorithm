     * You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.
     *
     * Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?
     *
     * Input: n = 2
     * Output: 2
     * Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
     * 1. 1 step + 1 step
     * 2. 2 steps
     *
     * Input: n = 3
     * Output: 3
     * Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
     * 1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
     * 2. 1 step + 2 steps
     * 3. 2 steps + 1 step
