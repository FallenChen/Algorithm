     * Given an array of integers citations where citations[i] is the number of citations a researcher received for their ith paper,
     * return compute the researcher's h-index.
     *
     * According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: A scientist has an index h if h of their n papers have at least h citations each,
     * and the other n âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each.
     *
     * If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.
     *
     * Input: citations = [3,0,6,1,5]
     * Output: 3
     * Explanation: [3,0,6,1,5] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively.
     * Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, their h-index is 3.
     *
     * Input: citations = [1,3,1]
     * Output: 1
     *
     * @param citations
     * @return
