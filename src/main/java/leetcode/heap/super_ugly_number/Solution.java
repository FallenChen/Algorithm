     * A super ugly number is a positive integer whose prime factors are in the array primes.
     *
     * Given an integer n and an array of integers primes, return the nth super ugly number.
     *
     * The nth super ugly number is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit signed integer.
     *
     * Input: n = 12, primes = [2,7,13,19]
     * Output: 32
     * Explanation: [1,2,4,7,8,13,14,16,19,26,28,32] is the sequence of the first 12 super ugly numbers given primes = [2,7,13,19].
     *
     * Input: n = 1, primes = [2,3,5]
     * Output: 1
     * Explanation: 1 has no prime factors, therefore all of its prime factors are in the array primes = [2,3,5].
     *
     * @param n
     * @param primes
     * @return
